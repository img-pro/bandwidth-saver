**Unlimited media CDN for WordPress. Serve images, video, audio, and HLS streams from 300+ global edge servers.**

## Overview

Heavy media files slow down your WordPress site. When videos buffer and images lag, visitors leave, Core Web Vitals fail, and Google ranks you lower.

**Bandwidth Saver** delivers all your media through Cloudflare's global edge network. No DNS changes. No external accounts. No configuration. Images, videos, audio files, and HLS streams load from the nearest server to each visitor.

Safe to try on any site. Does not touch your database or existing files. Disable at any time and your site instantly returns to normal. If Cloudflare ever has an issue, WordPress automatically loads your original media.

## How It Works

1. You upload media to WordPress as usual
2. The plugin rewrites media URLs on your frontend pages
3. When a visitor requests media, a Cloudflare Worker fetches it from your site and caches it in R2
4. Future requests serve cached media from Cloudflare's edge (300+ locations worldwide)

**Your original files stay on your server.** WordPress keeps full control. The plugin only changes how media is delivered to visitors.

## Supported Media Types

| Type | Formats | Features |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Images** | JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP, AVIF, SVG | Responsive srcset, lazy loading |
| **Video** | MP4, WebM, MOV | Range requests, seeking support |
| **Audio** | MP3, WAV, OGG, FLAC | Streaming playback |
| **HLS** | M3U8, TS | Adaptive bitrate streaming |

## Two Ways to Use

### Managed (Recommended)

One-click setup. We handle the Cloudflare infrastructure.

| Plan | Price | Features |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Unlimited** | $19.99/mo | Unlimited bandwidth, custom domain (CNAME), priority support |

**7-day money-back guarantee. Cancel anytime.**

### Self-Hosted (Free)

For developers who want full control. Deploy the open-source worker on your own Cloudflare account.

- Your media, your infrastructure
- Zero external dependencies
- Pay Cloudflare directly (usually $0/month on free tier)

**Requirements:**
- Cloudflare account (free tier works)
- Worker deployment ([see worker repo](https://github.com/img-pro/bandwidth-saver-worker))
- Custom domain pointing to your Worker

## Requirements

- WordPress 6.2 or higher
- PHP 7.4 or higher

## Installation

### Managed Setup (60 Seconds)

1. Install and activate the plugin
2. Go to **Settings > Bandwidth Saver**
3. Toggle the CDN switch on
4. Upgrade to Unlimited for $19.99/mo

Done. Media now loads from 300+ global CDN servers.

### Self-Hosted Setup

1. Create a free [Cloudflare account](https://cloudflare.com)
2. Deploy the worker from [bandwidth-saver-worker](https://github.com/img-pro/bandwidth-saver-worker)
3. Add a custom domain to your Worker (e.g., cdn.yoursite.com)
4. Enter your CDN domain in **Settings > Bandwidth Saver > Self-Host**

## Technical Details

### URL Rewriting

The plugin intercepts the final HTML output and rewrites media URLs:

```
Before: https://yoursite.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/video.mp4
After:  https://cdn.img.pro/yoursite.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/video.mp4
```

Rewriting happens at render time. Database URLs remain unchanged.

### Range Requests

Video and audio files support HTTP range requests for:
- Seeking to any position without downloading the entire file
- Resumable downloads
- Efficient bandwidth usage

### HLS Streaming

M3U8 playlists are served with correct MIME types. TS segments are cached at the edge for low-latency adaptive streaming.

### Cache Behavior

- Media is cached on first request
- Cache persists until explicitly purged
- Stale-while-revalidate for uninterrupted delivery
- Automatic fallback to origin if cache unavailable

### Request Tracking

Usage is tracked by request count (not bandwidth). View analytics in **Settings > Bandwidth Saver**.
